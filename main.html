	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
    I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology. 
    Creating applications that help people, automate tasks, and bring ideas to life excites me. 
    The field of development offers continuous learning, creativity, and the ability to make a positive impact.
